\item{max_interaction}{For the LCDM, the highest item-level interaction to
include in the model.}

\item{hierarchy}{Optional. If present, the quoted attribute hierarchy. See

for a tutorial on how to draw the attribute hierarchy.}

\value{
A measurement model object.

\description{
The measurement model defines how the items relate to the attributes. The
currently supported options for measurement models are:
Loglinear cognitive diagnostic model (LCDM); Deterministic input, noisy "and", gate (DINA); Deterministic input, noisy "or" gate (DINO); and Compensatory, reparameterized unified model (C-RUM).
See details for additional information on each model.

\details{
The LCDM (Henson et al., 2009; Henson & Templin, 2019) is a general
diagnostic classification model that subsumes the other more restrictive
models. The probability of a respondent providing a correct response is
parameterized like a regression model. For each item, the LCDM includes an
intercept, which represents the log-odds of providing a correct response
when none of the attributes required by the item are present. Main effect
parameters represent the increase in the log-odds for each required attribute
that is present. Finally, interaction terms define the change in log-odds
(after the main effects) when more than one of the required attributes are
present.

The C-RUM (Hartz, 2002) is similar to the LCDM, but is constrained to only
include the intercept and main effect parameters. That is, no interaction
terms are included for the C-RUM.

The DINA model (de la Torre & Douglas, 2004; Junker & Sijtsma, 2001) is a
restrictive non-compensatory model. For each item two parameters are
estimated. A guessing parameter defines the probability of a respondent
providing a correct response when not all of the required attributes are
present. Conversely, a slipping parameter defines the probability of
providing an incorrect response when all of the required attributes are
present. Thus, the DINA model takes an "all-or-nothing" approach. Either a
respondent has all of the attributes required for an item, or they do not.
There is no increase in the probability of providing a correct response if
only a subset of the required attributes is present.

The DINO model (Templin & Henson, 2006) is the inverse of the DINA model.
Whereas the DINA model is "all-or-nothing", the DINO model can be thought of
as "anything-or-nothing". In the DINO model, the guessing parameter defines
the probability of a correct response when none of the required attributes
are present. The slipping parameter is the probability of an incorrect
response when any of the required attributes is present. Therefore, when
using the DINO model, the presence of any of the required attributes results
in an increased probability of a correct response, and there is no additional
increase in probability for the presence of more than one of the required
attributes.
