\description{
Structural models define how the attributes are related to one another.
The currently supported options for structural models are:
unconstrained, independent attributes, log-linear, hierarchical diagnostic, classification model (HDCM) and Bayesian network.
See details for additional information on each model.
}
\details{
The unconstrained structural model places no constraints on how the
attributes relate to each other. This is equivalent to a saturated model
described by Hu & Templin (2020) and in Chapter 8 of Rupp et al. (2010).

The independent attributes model assumes that the presence of the attributes
are unrelated to each other. That is, there is no relationship between the
presence of one attribute and the presence of any other. For an example of
independent attributes model, see Lee (2016).

The loglinear structural model assumes that class membership proportions can
be estimated using a loglinear model that includes main and interaction
effects (see Xu & von Davier, 2008). A saturated loglinear structural model
includes interaction effects for all attributes measured in the model, and is
equivalent to the unconstrained structural model and the saturated model
described by Hu & Templin (2020) and in Chapter 8 of Rupp et al. (2010). A
reduced form of the loglinear structural model containing only main effects
is equivalent to an independent attributes model (e.g. Lee, 2016).

The hierarchical attributes model assumes some attributes must be mastered
before other attributes can be mastered. For an example of the hierarchical
attributes model, see Leighton et al. (2004) and Templin & Bradshaw (2014).

The Bayesian network model defines the statistical relationships between the
attributes using a directed acyclic graph and a joint probability
distribution. Attribute hierarchies are explicitly defined by decomposing the
joint distribution for the latent attribute space into a series of marginal
and conditional probability distributions. The unconstrained structural model
described in Chapter 8 of Rupp et al. (2010) can be parameterized as a
saturated Bayesian network (Hu & Templin, 2020). Further, structural models
implying an attribute hierarchy are viewed as nested models within a
saturated Bayesian network (Martinez & Templin, 2023).
