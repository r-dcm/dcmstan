# Overview

dcmstan provides functionality to automatically generate [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) code for estimating diagnostic classification models.
Using dcmstan, you can:

* Mix and match different [measurement](https://dcmstan.r-dcm.org/reference/measurement-model) and [structural](https://dcmstan.r-dcm.org/reference/structural-model) models to specify a diagnostic model with `dcm_specify()`,
* Define `prior()` distributions, and
* Generate Stan code for the model, given the specifications and priors with `stan_code()`

dcmstan is used as a backend for generating the Stan code needed to estimate and evaluate with the [measr](https://measr.info) package.
If you use measr to estimate your models, you will not need to use dcmstan to generate Stan code yourself.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dcmstan from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("r-dcm/dcmstan")
```

## Usage

```{r example}
library(dcmstan)
library(dcmdata)

new_model <- dcm_specify(qmatrix = mdm_qmatrix, identifier = "item",
                         measurement_model = lcdm(),
                         structural_model = unconstrained())

stan_code(new_model)
```
